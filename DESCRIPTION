Description: The goal of maidrr is to aid you in the development of a Model-Agnostic Interpretable Data-driven suRRogate for your black box algorithm of choice. 
  In short, these are the steps in the procedure: 
  1) Partial dependencies (PDs) are used to obtain model insights from the black box in the form of feature effects.
  2) Those effects are used to group values/levels within a feature in an optimal data-driven way, while performing built-in feature selection.
  3) An interpretable GLM surrogate is fit to the segmented features. Meaningful interactions can be included if desired.
