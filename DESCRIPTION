Description: Implementation of the mAIDs procedure in R.
    Develop an interpretable surrogate for any type of black box algorithm.
    Partial dependencies are used to obtain model insights and group feature levels.
    The segmentation happens in a data-driven way with built-in feature selection.
    A (G)LM is fit to the categorical features and meaningful interactions.
